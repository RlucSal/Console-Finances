# Console-Finances

## Description 

### Develop a code for analizing the financial records of a company trough a financial dataset provided that satisties the following acceptable criteria:

1. The total number of months included in the dataset.
2. The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.
3. The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.
4. The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.
5. The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

### Motivation 

1. Efficiency: Manual analysis of financial data can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Writing code to automate the process can significantly improve efficiency and reduce the time required for analysis.
2. Accuracy: Automated code can perform calculations and comparisons with high accuracy, reducing the chances of human errors that might occur during manual analysis.
3. Consistency: Automated code ensures that financial data is consistently analyzed using the same criteria and methods every time, eliminating variations due to human subjectivity.
4. Scalability: Code can handle large volumes of financial data with ease. This means it can be used to analyze data for multiple periods and multiple companies without a proportional increase in effort.
5. Rapid Insights: Automation allows for quicker access to financial insights. You can get an overview of financial trends and anomalies in real-time or with minimal delay.
6. Historical Comparisons: Code can facilitate comparisons between current financial data and historical records, allowing you to assess long-term trends and identify changes.
7. Complex Analysis: Code can perform complex financial analyses that may be difficult or impractical to do manually. For example, it can calculate ratios, assess risk, or perform forecasting.
8. Data Visualization: Code can be used to create visualizations, such as charts and graphs, to present financial data in a more understandable and actionable way.
9. Reproducibility: The code can be used to reproduce the same analysis in the future, ensuring that financial data is consistently interpreted and that results can be compared over time.
10. Cost Savings: Automating financial analysis can potentially reduce the need for hiring additional staff or using expensive third-party tools.
11. Educational and Skill Development: Developing code for financial analysis can be a great learning opportunity. It allows you to improve your programming skills and deepen your understanding of financial concepts.
